Computer Vision 
1) Build an API that can take image documents as input and should be able to return a summary of the content in that image. 
The input image can be photos of text documents. 
The output should be a summary of the image content. 
Open-source/proprietary language/vision models can be used in the process.
A flask/FastAPI endpoint of the tool is also desirable. 
2) Build an API that can take camera video footage as input and convert it to depth maps in real time. 
The input should be an RGB video stream.
The output should be a depth map stream generated from the video in real-time.
The latency should be minimal. 
Open-source 3D-depth-estimation models might be useful here. 
Flask/FastAPI endpoint of the tool is also desirable. 


Natural Language Processing/ Speech Processing: 
1) Build a chatbot that can understand context from a collection of speech data.
Open-source/proprietary models can be used. 
The language model should be an instruction fine-tuned model. 
The speech data should be embedded into a vector database for retrieval.
2) Build an agent-based language models system that can take in different roles to complete tasks.
The input prompt should be a task that the system needs to complete.
The system should create task-specific workers that should interact to get the task done. 
The final output can be in text format.

Please refer to the README.md file in each project folder for the complete setup instructions.
