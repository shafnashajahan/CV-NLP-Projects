To build an API that takes image documents as input and returns a summary of their content, you can use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the images and then apply a summarization model to the extracted text. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this Python code provided.

Step-by-Step Guide
Extract Text from Images:

Use Tesseract OCR for extracting text from images.
Summarize the Extracted Text:

Use a pre-trained summarization model such as Hugging Face's transformers library.
Create a Flask API:

Set up a Flask application to handle image uploads and return summaries.


Setup:

Save app.py and requirements.txt in the same directory.
Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app: python app.py
