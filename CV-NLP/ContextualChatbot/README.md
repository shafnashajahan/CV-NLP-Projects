## Features
Speech-to-Text: Converts audio input into text using Vosk.
Contextual Understanding: Embeds text into vectors and stores them in FAISS for efficient retrieval.
Natural Language Generation: Generates contextually relevant responses using a fine-tuned language model.
Modular Design: Easily replaceable components for customization and scaling.


## Requirements
Python 3.7+

## Required Python packages:
vosk
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
transformers
numpy

### Installation

**Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shafnashajahan/CV-NLP-Projects.git
   cd image-summarization-api

 ```

## 1. Transcribe Audio
Use transcribe.py to convert an audio file into text.

Copy code
python transcribe.py path/to/audio/file.wav
## 2. Generate Embeddings and Store in FAISS
Use embedding.py to generate embeddings from text and store them in FAISS.

Copy code
python embedding.py
## 3. Generate Responses
Use response_generator.py to generate responses based on a given prompt.

Copy code
python response_generator.py
## 4. Run the Full Pipeline
Use main.py to run the entire pipeline: transcribing audio, generating embeddings, retrieving context, and generating a response.
Copy code
python main.py
# Example
Given an audio file with the user asking, "What's the weather like today? Should I go for a hike?",
the system will process the audio and generate a response like:
Copy code
The weather today is sunny with a slight breeze—perfect conditions for a hike. I suggest heading out to a nearby trail and enjoying the great outdoors!

Customization
Speech-to-Text: Replace the Vosk model with any other STT engine if needed.
Embeddings: Swap out SentenceTransformer for any other embedding technique.
Language Model: Use a different pre-trained model from Hugging Face or fine-tune your own model for specific domains.
