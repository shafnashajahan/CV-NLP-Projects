Overview
This project implements a real-time depth estimation system using Flask and the MiDaS deep learning model. It captures video frames from a webcam, processes them to generate depth maps, and streams these depth maps to a web browser. The application demonstrates how to integrate computer vision and deep learning with web technologies to provide real-time visual information.

Key Features
Real-Time Video Capture: Uses OpenCV to capture video frames from a webcam.
Depth Estimation: Utilizes the MiDaS model to estimate depth from RGB images.
Streaming: Streams depth maps to a web browser in real-time using Flask.
Components
Flask Application (app.py): Serves the depth maps as a continuous video stream.
Depth Estimation (depth_estimation.py): Contains functions to preprocess frames and estimate depth using the MiDaS model.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/shafnashajahan/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Set Up the Environment:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Application:

python app.py
View the Stream:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/video_feed to view the real-time depth map stream.

Troubleshooting
Camera Issues: Ensure the webcam is properly connected and accessible. Adjust the camera index in cv2.VideoCapture(0) if needed.
Dependency Problems: Verify that all required packages are installed. Recreate the virtual environment and reinstall dependencies if issues arise.
